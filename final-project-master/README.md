Open Street Map (OSM) provides open map data to websites, mobile applications, and hardware devices. It is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain worldwide data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more.

In this project, we will be analyzing data to make cafe, hotel and route recommendations to tourists visiting Vancouver BC. 

Prerequisites: 

You will need to install python and pip install the following packages: 

1) pandas 
2) numpy 
3) folium
4) matplotlib 
5) math
6) seaborn 
7) geopandas 
8) shapely 
9) sklearn

This repository contains jupyter notebooks where the output plots and diagrams are within. We have added snippets of these plots in our PDF report as well.
